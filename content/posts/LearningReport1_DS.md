I am able to understand the layering of GitHub's file system and understand how Hugo creates a website through this coding software and use it to create this page.
I was able to be able to program the hugo website and allow the read more button to work to go to the sample page, which will be changed to this page once I finish this file.  
We are able to control this website using Github and Netlify but we haven't compared any other systems.
I have adapted your teaching to be able to change this to the read more button, as well as reading Canvas assignments carefully to figure out how to add this post.
I have learned to use Microsoft Team and Canvas to able to manage our workload and keep connected with other students so that we can work well and on time, as well be able to learn off the class' online resources.
