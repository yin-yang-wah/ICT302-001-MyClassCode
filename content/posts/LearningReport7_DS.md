I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I understand the use of Markdown and CSS to style the website pages, depending on the programming language, which it is Markdown for Hugo or HTML for WordPress.
I am able to use HTML to create unique layouts for Wordpress blog pages along with using blocks.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I am currently using Hugo, Github and Netifly for the learning reports and I am using WordPress to work on blog post for the class. 
I am better able to compare the whole CMS of WordPress to Hugo, using the advice Barker gives, such as compare each one as a whole, not just feature to feature.

Benefits of WordPress over Hugo
=====================================
+ More flexible when coding/creating website.
+ Easier to control layout from site creation.
+ Blocks can be easier to use at times than Markdown.

Benefits of Hugo over WordPress
=====================================
+ Markdown is simplier to understand than HTML to beginners.
+ Easier to type down paragraphs and lists.
+ Seperation of files means better organization of code and easier to find specific code.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I am able to use Github to organize and manage our website pages. I use Netifly to show me when something is not working as it should and to test new functions. 
I am able to use Wordpress to edit and change what is on my blog post and what HTML is being used for the page and the location of features on the blog, such as tables, pictures or lists

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I understand to use code such as CSS, HTML, and Markdown and use services such as GitHub, Netifly, and Hugo to create simple and clean pages, including these learning reports. 
I can now use WordPress to make word pages and blog posts that are clean and more accessable to my teammates.
I can also use Teams and other text-based platforms to control the workflows and connect with other members.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been able to use the WordPress Archives site to learn and understand more about the services and benefits of using WordPress and what all you can do with the system of WordPress.
