I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I understand the use of Markdown and CSS to style the website pages, depending on the programming language, which it is Markdown for Hugo.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I am currently using Hugo, Github and Netifly to manage my content, but we have not used any other content management systems at the moment.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I am able to use Github to organize and manage our website pages. I use Netifly to show me when something is not working as it should and to test new functions.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I understand to use code such as CSS, HTML, and Markdown and use services such as GitHub, Netifly, and Hugo to create simple and clean pages, including these learning reports. 
I can also use Teams and other text-based platforms to control the workflows and connect with other members.
I also use the themes to present the content in new and more unique ways.

Things that can be edited in themes:
====================================================================
+ font.
+ color of background
+ color of the text and area around the text.
+ page structure.
+ location of images and menus and text.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been able to use the Hugo main site to learn and understand more about the services and benefits of using Hugo over standard ways of making websites. I used the README files with the themes to learn more about how to edit and use them.
