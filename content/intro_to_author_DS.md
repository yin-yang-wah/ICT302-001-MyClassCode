Hello there, visitor of my site. My name is Dylan and I am an student for the ICT302 class. I am a team captain of an E-sports team, which is the *Magic the Gathering Arena* team. 
I also am in love with *chess*, though I don't play as much as I used to. I was a captain of my hometown chess team and competed in several national events. However, I have gotten rusty due to the lack of people who want to play chess amongst the students.
I love board games and card games, especially *cooperative* ones. I tend to stuggle with dice, which is bad for most games. I am also part of a *Dungeons and Dragons* group and currently being a DM for a session.

###My favorite things
+Chess
+Magic the Gathering
+Dungeons and Dragons
+Super Smash Brothers
+Fighting Games
